Prebuilt artifacts
==================

These are third-party dependencies that we need a prebuilt binary/artifact
during the workshop. The list includes:

- A [custom Perfetto UI](https://github.com/cactusdynamics/perfetto)

The `Makefile` is how the artifacts in this directory are built. It can only be
run from an amd64 machine.
