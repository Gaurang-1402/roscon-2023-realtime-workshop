          <p class="text-justify">
            Ensuring the worst-case execution time of software to remain within
            a known bound is challenging, especially given the complexity of
            modern software and hardware stacks. This workshop aims to teach
            robotics engineers the basics of real-time programming and how this
            can be accomplished with ROS 2. The audience should walk out of the
            workshop with a good grasp of how to approach real-time programs
            and some hands-on experience with programming real-time
            applications both in and out of the ROS context.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The workshop is divided into a morning session and an afternoon
            session. In the morning, the main goal is to introduce the audience
            to the foundation of real-time programming without ROS. In the
            afternoon, the main goal is to apply the knowledge to ROS 2 and
            learn about the concepts and limitations of the execution
            management of ROS 2 Humble. We intend to both present an
            experimental, out-of-tree real-time ROS 2 executor that can be used
            for real-time applications as well as present best practices for
            achieving real-time behaviors within mainline ROS 2 executors.
            Finally, we intend to hold a panel discussion about the open
            challenges for enabling real-time within ROS 2.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The workshop will cover two typical use-cases over a number of
            hands-on exercises. In the morning, we will present an inverted
            pendulum controller demo. This allows us to cover the use case of
            1000 Hz real-time control-loop with a single ROS 2 node. In the
            afternoon, we will present a simulated camera safety system
            constructed with multiple ROS 2 nodes. This allows us to cover the
            use case of 60 Hz real-time within a larger ROS 2 network. All demo
            code will be made available during the workshop.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            We intend for the workshop to have the following impact on the ROS
            community: (1) transfer knowledge to robotics engineers about
            real-time system concepts and ROS 2 execution management; (2)
            enable robotics engineers to build real-time applications with ROS
            2; and (3) spread the knowledge of real-time ROS 2 in the community
            such that its development can be further accelerated.

          <h2>Requirements for the workshop exercises</h2>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The workshop exercises are designed for groups of 3 to 5 people. We
            will run all exercises on laptops running Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2
            Humble as well as Raspberry Pi 4s. Each group should have at least
            one laptop and one Raspberry Pi 4. Due to cost and logistical
            challenges, we cannot provide these equipment to all attendees and
            attendees must bring their own equipment, or join a group with the
            required equipments. Ahead of the workshop, we will ask attendees
            who intend to bring their own Raspberry Pi 4s to flash a special
            workshop-specific image onto the SD cards. This will be
            communicated at a later time.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            Since not everyone will have a Raspberry Pi 4, please note that if
            you intend to bring your own, you may be asked to form groups with
            2 to 4 other people who may not have Raspberry Pi 4s and
            collaborate with them during the exercises.
