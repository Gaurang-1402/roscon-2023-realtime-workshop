          <h2 class="text-center">Program description and goals</h2>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Ensuring the worst-case execution time of software to remain within
            a known bound is challenging, especially given the complexity of
            modern software and hardware stacks. This workshop aims to teach
            robotics engineers the basics of real-time programming and how this
            can be accomplished with ROS 2. The audience should walk out of the
            workshop with a good grasp of how to approach real-time programs
            and some hands-on experience with programming real-time
            applications both in and out of the ROS context.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The workshop is divided into a morning session and an afternoon
            session. In the morning, the main goal is to introduce the audience
            to the foundation of real-time programming without ROS. In the
            afternoon, the main goal is to apply the knowledge to ROS 2 and
            learn about the concepts and limitations of the execution
            management of ROS 2 Humble. We intend to both present an
            experimental, out-of-tree real-time ROS 2 executor that can be used
            for real-time applications as well as present best practices for
            achieving real-time behaviors within mainline ROS 2 executors.
            Finally, we intend to hold a panel discussion about the open
            challenges for enabling real-time within ROS 2.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The workshop will cover two typical use-cases over a number of
            hands-on exercises. In the morning, we will present an inverted
            pendulum controller demo. This allows us to cover the use case of
            1000 Hz real-time control-loop with a single ROS 2 node. In the
            afternoon, we will present a simulated camera safety system
            constructed with multiple ROS 2 nodes. This allows us to cover the
            use case of 60 Hz real-time within a larger ROS 2 network. All demo
            code will be made available during the workshop.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            We intend for the workshop to have the following impact on the ROS
            community: (1) transfer knowledge to robotics engineers about
            real-time system concepts and ROS 2 execution management; (2)
            enable robotics engineers to build real-time applications with ROS
            2; and (3) spread the knowledge of real-time ROS 2 in the community
            such that its development can be further accelerated.

          <h2>Requirements for the workshop exercises</h2>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The workshop exercises are designed for groups of 3 to 5 people. We
            will run all exercises on laptops running Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2
            Humble as well as Raspberry Pi 4s. We are pleased to be able to
            loan some Raspberry Pi 4s to the attendees, but you are also
            welcome to bring your own.
          </p>

          <p>
          Prior to the workshop, we would appreciate if everyone can follow the
          instructions <a href="https://github.com/ros-realtime/roscon-2023-realtime-workshop">here</a>
          to setup your laptops with the appropriate Docker image. If you are
          bringing your own Raspberry Pi 4s, there are also instructions to set
          that up.
          </p>
